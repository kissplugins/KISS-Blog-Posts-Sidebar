## Description
The **KISS Blog Posts Sidebar** plugin provides a beautiful, modern, and highly customizable widget to display your recent blog posts. Using the WordPress REST API for fast, asynchronous loading, it presents posts in a clean, tile-based layout with featured images, titles, excerpts, and dates.

	- Drop Shadow (Blur, Spread, Color, Opacity)

	- Content Padding
- **Simple Widget:** Easy to add to any sidebar or widget-ready area.
- **Developer Friendly:** Includes an optional debug mode for easy troubleshooting.
- **Lightweight & Efficient:** Built with performance in mind.
## Installation
1. Upload the `kiss-blog-posts-sidebar` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to **Appearance > Widgets**.
4. Drag the **KISS Blog Posts Sidebar** widget to your desired sidebar.
5. Configure the widget title and the number of posts to display.
## Configuration
### Widget Settings
Once you add the widget to a sidebar, you can configure two options directly:
- **Title:** The title that appears above the post tiles (e.g., "Recent Posts").
- **Number of posts:** How many recent posts to display (from 1 to 20).
### Plugin Settings
For detailed styling options, navigate to **Settings > KISS Blog Posts** in your WordPress dashboard. Here you can customize the visual appearance of the tiles.
- **Styling Options:** Control the roundness of corners, the size and color of the drop shadow, and the spacing between and within the tiles.
- **Debugging:** A dedicated section for troubleshooting.
	- **Enable Debug Mode:** If you are having issues (e.g., images not appearing), you can enable this setting. It will display the raw data being sent to the widget, which is invaluable for diagnosing problems.
## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
**Where does the plugin get its thumbnail images from?**
The plugin is designed to be efficient and flexible. It retrieves the featured image for each post by checking for available image sizes in a specific order:
1. It first looks for the `medium` size image. This is the preferred size as it typically offers the best balance of quality and file size for a sidebar.
2. If a `medium` version is not available, it falls back to the `thumbnail` size.
3. If neither of those is found, it will use the `full` size (the original, unmodified image you uploaded).
To prevent blurry images, you should ensure your **Medium** image size is large enough for the widget area. You can adjust this in your WordPress dashboard under **Settings > Media**.
## Troubleshooting
### Featured Images Are Blurry
Blurry thumbnails are usually caused by WordPress generating images that are too small for the space they need to fill.
1. **Check Media Settings:** Go to **Settings > Media** and ensure your `Medium` size settings are large enough for the widget area. Consult your theme's documentation for recommended sizes.
2. **Regenerate Thumbnails:** After correcting your media settings, you must regenerate the thumbnails for your existing images. The easiest way is to use a plugin like [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/). Install it, go to **Tools > Regenerate Thumbnails**, and run the process.

If the first plugin does not work, we recommend trying this one:

### Featured Images Are Not Showing Up
1. **Verify the Post Has a Featured Image:** First, edit the post in question and confirm that a "Featured Image" has been set in the WordPress editor.
2. **Enable Debug Mode:** Go to **Settings > KISS Blog Posts > Debugging** and check the "Enable Debug Mode" box.
3. **Check the Debug Output:** Refresh your site's front end. The widget will now display the raw data for each post. Look at the `featured_image` field.
	- If the field is an empty string (`""`), it means WordPress could not find a featured image for that post.
	- If the field contains a URL, but the image still doesn't show, there may be a caching issue or a problem with your theme's CSS interfering with the plugin.
